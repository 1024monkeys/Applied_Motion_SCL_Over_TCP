# Applied_Motion_SCL_Over_TCP
Testing Applied Motion's SCL interface over a TCP connection with ssm23q-2eg drives.

This is an alternative to the UDP protocol they have in their (Applied Motion's) example files.

This code uses Python 2.7.  Works, but is incomplete, lacking many safeguards.  Use at your own risk.

I have no affiliation with Applied Motion, I'm sure that they're nice folks though.
