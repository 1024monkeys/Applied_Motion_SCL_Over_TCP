# Applied_Motion_SCL_Over_TCP
Testing Applied Motion's SCL interface over a TCP connection with ssm23q-2eg drives.

This is an alternative to the UDP protocol they have in their (Applied Motion's) example files.

This code uses Python 2.7.  Works, but is incomplete, lacking many safe-guards.  Use at your own risk.

I have no affiliation with Applied Motion.  This code was developed to test their hardware in a demo-situation.
